An innovative agricultural solution involving Precision Agriculture ...
Idea/Problem Statement Summary
India's agricultural sector, which employs over 50% of the workforce and contributes 15% to the GDP, is facing a crisis marked by water scarcity, soil degradation, and inefficient traditional farming practices, resulting in significant food security and sustainability challenges. The sector's growth has declined sharply to 1.4% in FY24, exacerbated by severe water wastage, accelerated soil erosion, and low rural incomes, disproportionately affecting farmers who lack resources and knowledge to adopt sustainable practices. 
Our solution Project Samarth Krushak will combat the above problem by the following practices:-
Utilize advanced drones and IoT sensors to collect and analyze real-time field data, offering a more precise and efficient approach to resource management and reducing water wastage compared to traditional methods.
Utilize AI algorithms for pest detection, disease diagnosis, and nutrient analysis to improve crop health and yield.
Facilitate data storage, analysis, and visualization for actionable insights, while ensuring the platform is user-friendly for farmers with varying technical backgrounds.
